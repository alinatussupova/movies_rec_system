<p>I developed a movie recommendation system, based on each filtering, using data science and machine learning techniques.</p>
<p><strong>What did I do during the project: </strong>I loaded the data, using Pandas. From that data created the dataset, and built the trainset. Based on this trainset, I trained the ML model and generated the predictions.</p>
